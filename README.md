# Ecommerce_Store
My first Power Bi project. Here I've imported two CSV files with data's from a eCommerce store and I've created a dashboard out of them so that it's profits, sales and payment methods can be analysed individually.
Here I've used two individual Data sets from the same source of eCommerce store and each of the files are uploaded alongside the Bi output file.
I've used bar charts, column charts, donut charts, kpi's for individual characteristics and slicers.
